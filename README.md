# RSC Shop

This project was my first attempt at creating a simple React ecommerce app. This app doesn't feature advanced react concepts such as useReducer, and useContext. I kept it fairly simple. Only using useState, and useEffect mostly. I ran into a lot of issues when it came to styling, which led me having to hardcode a lot of the margins. Not ideal for maintenance.

# Demo
